Random scripts and tools for using across machines.

= Running a MineCraft Server on a Raspberry Pi Over WiFi in a Car =
Lots of articles on the web of varying age for how to get an RPi to run a MC server,
not much glue scripting and how-to. What we wanted was to be able to have PCs running
on battery and a local low-power wifi network in our car so kids in the vehicle could\
all play, at least until the batteries ran out.

== Compatibility and Performance ==
Tried MineCraft official server 1.12 on an RPi 2, did not make the grade, tons of lag.

Tried Spigot's server and it performed better, far fewer hiccups, but still some lag from clients running on
a local wifi network with direct Ethernet jacked between the wifi endpoint and the RPi.
 
Upgrade to an RPi 3: Data pending. One of the reasons for this repo is to move scripts
between Pi machines.
